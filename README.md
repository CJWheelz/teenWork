Winner of the 2021 Congressional App Challenge.

Built my Junior Spring and Senior Fall of high school for an independent study in iOS app development with SwiftUI and Firebase.

You can see a demo of my app [here](https://youtu.be/YbaPMY5pyNA) as part of my submission to the Congressional App Challenge.

Here are some screenshots from the app:
